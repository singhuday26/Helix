## Strategic Notes

### The "Top 1%" Mindset
1. **Falsifiable Claims** — Make specific, testable predictions
2. **Explicit Trade-offs** — Show what you sacrificed and why
3. **Systems > Features** — Think architecture, not checkboxes
4. **Demo God** — The happy path must be flawless; hardcode if needed

### Network Advantage
- IIEC has core fiber backbone
- Still expect Wi-Fi congestion with 500+ devs
- Mitigation: Local caching, 5G hotspot, pre-fetched dependencies
